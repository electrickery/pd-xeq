The shared framework is based on the object list from Pd, but applied on event lists. This technique is similar to the modern [array] and [text] objects.

shared framework map:

hyphen manages connections between entities and keeps two lists of collections, one for hosts and one for friends. Both are stored as hashes, so can be efficiently retrieved.

dict is the layer that does the actual storing and retrieving of the event lists.

mfbb is the midifile binbuf interface.

mifi handles the high level part of reading and writing midi files.

bifi is the low level part of reading and writing files.

sq are the sequencer utilities.

text are the text utilities.

vefl is the interface to garrays. It is present, but not used in the xeq framework.
